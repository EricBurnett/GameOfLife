The Game of Life
================
Rendering engine for watching Life patterns evolve, created with Python 2.6 and
PyGame.

* Implements the HashLife algorithm, so patterns can be viewed at super-linear
speeds with moderate requirements.
* Can load basic .lif and .cells files, for easy use.

Controls:
--------
Up/Down/Left/Right: Pan the viewport
+/-: Speed up or slow down the rate of evolution
PageUp/PageDown: Zoom in/out
